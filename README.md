FAQ Chatbot
A simple chatbot that answers questions from a FAQ list using Python, Gradio, and scikit-learn.

How it Works
Loads questions and answers from faqs.csv.
Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find the closest matching question.
Returns the answer or asks for clarification if no match is found.

Example:
User: How do I reset my password?
Chatbot: Click on 'Forgot Password' and follow the instructions.
